            Alison Lee, was a loving, kind and devoted daughter to Michelle and David Lee. Born on the 27th of November 1999, in Alison Springs, California, Alison was a bubbly and joyful child who lit up the lives of everyone she interacted with. Alison attended McAuthurs Private School where she met her then-to-be boyfriend, Charles Matthews. After she graduated from high school she started studying a Bachelor of Science at Harvard University. She always envisioned herself one day being able to cure cancer. During university, she met Charles again and they started dating, eventually moving in together.

            On the 1st of October 20 2021, at 10 pm, Alison was found dead by her mother and Father who had come to visit her. She was found lying on the kitchen floor in the home she shared with Charles with 3 bullet holes in the face and chest. Charles was later also found, dead, lying on his bed. 911 was called immediately and police soon arrived at the scene. The time of death was estimated to be 4 pm that day.

            Police found a note on the floor in the room Alison and Charles shared. In the note, Alison wrote how she planned to leave Charles during his weekend work trip. She stated that although she loved him, she was leaving him because he was “violent” and “toxic”. Police noted that the note had been crumpled and thrown on the floor as if someone had seen it and then discarded it with anger. Police also noted that this was the very room that Charles was found dead in, and this was the weekend he was supposed to be away.

            Police found Charles's phone on his table. Through further inspection, they discovered that not only had he suspiciously bought highly concentrated sleeping pills on the day of Alison’s death but also a gun from the local Walmart store. Charles's history never showed a pattern of sleeping issues or that he had ever owned a gun in his life.

            The gun was an old hand pistol dating back to the 80s and matched with the receipt from Walmart where Charles had gone to. Why Charles decided to buy this particular gun? We will never know. The bullets and gun were sent back to D.C and analysed to see if they matched the bullets found in Alison’s body. There was a clear match. It looked like the cause of death was from the shots of the gun. From the note and other incriminating evidence that police found, it was clear to see that Charles had killed her.

            Although the cause of death was early on suspected to be from the gun wounds, an autopsy of Alison’s body revealed that she had in fact drunk an iron tonic that contained an unknown powdery substance before her death. The tonic itself was not poisonous and Alison had drank it every day, but the unknown powder at the bottom of the bottle was very suspicious. The tonic remains in her body were sent to the lab along with the bottle itself, to determine what the substance was.

            Police later discovered the sleeping pills Charles had purchased, and lab reports confirmed that the mysterious white powder at the bottom of the bottle that found in Alison’s body was crushed up sleeping pills. Police surmise that Charles came home earlier than expected, saw Alison’s note, and in anger decided to kill her. He first bought the sleeping pills and crushed it into the tonic she drank, then after her death from the pills, bought the gun, came back and shot her in a fit of rage.

            What police found suspiciously odd was the footprints of size 10 men's shoes on the inside of the home. Charles did not wear size 10 shoes, furthermore, the mud from the footprints was found to have been made at the very time that police established Charles shot Alison. Was there a second accomplice? A witness who saw these events unfold?

            Police also found a packet of chips with some of the chip pieces around about the area the footprints were found, 2 metres away from Alison’s body. The DNA from saliva and skin found on the chips did not belong to Charles either. Questioning suspects, family members and close friends turned up no clues as to who this mysterious person was. It seems this mystery would not be solved.

            Charles's death was established to be the same cause as Alison’s. A drink found on his bedside table contained the dangerous powder substance that killed Alison, and an autopsy of Charle’s body confirmed that this is what killed him. Police surmise that after killing Alison, Charle’s decided to kill himself by drinking the same substance.

            Although this is the end of Alison and Charles's sad account of love, hate, revenge and death, the story still lives on in the museum of Aprodites in Texas. This museum is dedicated to housing collections of evidence found during crimes. The collection of evidence from Alison and Charles’s story can be viewed there.
